# CachedRepository

This repository provides an implementation of a cached repository pattern in C#. The repository demonstrates how to use caching mechanisms alongside a repository pattern to optimize data retrieval and reduce database calls. By utilizing this approach, it helps improve performance in applications where frequent data access is required. The codebase integrates basic caching techniques and offers a practical solution for scenarios where reducing latency and load on the database is essential.

## Features
- Cached repository pattern implementation
- Optimized database access
- Performance improvement strategies
